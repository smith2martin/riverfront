			Dock and Boat Storage Installed

		<!-- Description -->
		<p class="item_description">
			The installation of the multi-level dock in the Park was a monumental step forward for the usability and enjoyment of the Park. Together with multiple boat storage racks, residents are now able to enjoy the benefits of living directly on the river:
			easy access to launch their personal watercraft, fishing, and swimming are now some of the most popular activities down at the Park.
