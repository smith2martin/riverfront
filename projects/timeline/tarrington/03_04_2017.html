    <p class="item_description">
        Committee volunteers were hard at work this spring blazing a new trail to loop the upriver-most point back around to the parking area, with a cut-through to the picnic area.
    </p>
    <p class="item_description">
        This new trail also loops past a wetlands area that holds water for a fair portion of the year -- a great place for little ones to explore.
    </p>
    <p class="item_description">
        Come help us break in the trail!
